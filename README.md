This repo is organized into several sub-folders. Any files not in the sub-folders are used in multiple scripts 
(transfer functions, graphing set up). 

Within in each sub-folder there is top.script that runs and outlines all the scripts within 
that particular subfolder.

Each subfolder additionally has any .RDS output from the models so that STAN models don't
need to be re-run. 


Subfolders:


Daphnia - has all of the code and data for fitting Daphnia magna parameters


Master_Data - has raw data files and code for data cleaning


Nitrogen_Algae - has all the code and data for fitting algal parameters (NOT CLEANED AS OF 4/6/2020)


Ceriodaphnia - has all code related to Ceriodaphnia (Likely to be removed because not being used for this project)


Early_Attempts - has all code that I tried when I was exploring data and trying to learn STAN code.
